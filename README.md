# UnityEditorTools

I am working on this project to make simple editor tools that anyone can use in their projects. I hope this tools will be helpful for anyone out there to make project structure faster in unity.


# Serialized Dictionary

To make dictionary serializable in inspector window you can do it like this

# Steps

1) Import unity package in your unity project.
2) Implement "SerializableMonoBehaviour" class instead of "MonoBehaviour"
3) Create dictionary variable from "SerializableDictionary" instead of normal "Dictionary".
4) There you go, now you can see dictionary serialized in your inspector.

I hope this will help you.
