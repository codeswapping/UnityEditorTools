# UnityEditorTools

I am working on this project to make simple editor tools that anyone can use in their projects. I hope this tools will be helpful for anyone out there to make project structure faster in unity.


# Serialized Dictionary

To make dictionary serializable in inspector window you can do it like this

# Steps

1) Import unity package in your unity project.
2) Implement "SerializableMonoBehaviour" class instead of "MonoBehaviour"
3) Create dictionary variable from "SerializableDictionary" instead of normal "Dictionary".
4) There you go, now you can see dictionary serialized in your inspector.

I hope this will help you.

Note: I am still working on this project and I can't garrenty any loss through using this tool. Please use only on your own concern. It is still not perfect. I would suggest first try it on empty project and then use it for any other project.
